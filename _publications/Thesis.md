Polymer brushes are versatile surface modification tools, wherein composition, architecture and biological functionality can be controlled precisely and independently. By growing biomimetic polymer chains from substrate-bound initiator sites through atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), engineered biointerfaces were developed for four application areas.
