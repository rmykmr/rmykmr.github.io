Thanks for visiting my web page. Here you can find links to my papers, talks and descriptions of my research projects and interests. Following is a brief bio sketch. 

I was born in Madurai, Tamil Nadu to parents who were both first-generation college graduates, and valued educational attainment over material ones. I was raised in the coastal city of Madras, where I completed my schooling. I lived a five minute bicycle ride away from school in what used to be a quiet leafy neighbourhood by the beach. 

My academic journey has not followed a traditional linear trajectory. I graduated with distinction in Chemical engineering from BITS Pilani (Pilani campus) which was a grueling thirty six-hour journey from my hometown. I won the Monali Dey Memorial Award, which is awarded to a student of every graduating batch for extracurricular and academic excellence. In my senior year, I was offered a job with Dr. Reddy’s Labs (DRL) a research-driven Indian pharmaceutical company. In the three years I spent at DRL, I worked alongside synthetic chemists and chemical engineers on the design, development and scale-up of small molecule drugs.  I contributed to two patents and was responsible for the commercial launch of three drugs. I also conducted exploratory research on continuous API manufacturing and process analytical technology.  I became more resourceful and resilient as a scientist as a result of designing processes that had to work not just in the fume hood, but also at the production plant.  Though I relished the challenges unique to industrial research, I couldn’t envision a career in industry and felt a calling to teaching and academic research. I applied for a PhD in chemical engineering, and was fortunate to be accepted by the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. 

At Michigan, I chose to work with Prof. Joerg Lahann. Joerg leads a group that implements niche macromolecular engineering tools, mainly electrohydrodynamic (EHD) co-jetting and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) polymerization to develop programmable materials that are routinely deployed at the forefront of translational biomedical research. To complement EHD co-jetting and CVD, I established a third platform technology in Lahann Lab by adopting a rational model-derived approach for the design and synthesis of biomimetic polymer brushes. My multifunctional platform incorporates paryelene copolymers, zwitterionic and carbohydrate polymer brushes to solve diverse problems at the interface of biology and polymers. You can read more about my doctoral research here.  I was fortunate to be awarded the Rackham Predoctoral Fellowship through a university-level competition, which allowed me to chart an independent and ambitious course of research in my final year. I have also received a Procter & Gamble Team Innovation Award, the Richard & Eleanor Towner Prize for Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor and several poster prizes. Research apart, I have a deep interest in teaching and mentoring. I served as an instructor for one semester, as a teaching consultant for two years and have mentored five talented undergraduate researchers during my PhD. 

I have recently accepted a position in Prof. Theresa Reineke’s lab at the University of Minnesota. As a post-doc, I will combine my experience in synthesizing carbohydrate and zwitterionic materials with my statistical modeling frameworks to accelerate the discovery and optimization of polymeric vehicles for gene editing. 

I am lucky to have a life outside lab and I make the best of time away from research.  I love literary fiction and would readily be stranded on an island with the complete works of Edith Wharton, F. Scott Fitzgerald, D.H. Lawrence, Jane Austen and Henry James. Like most of my countrymen, I am an ardent armchair cricket critic and a hopeless tennis-ball cricketer. When I'm not reading or following cricket, you can find me training for a road race and I've completed seven half-marathons so far.
