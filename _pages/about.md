I was born in Madurai, Tamil Nadu to parents who were both employed by the Indian government. I was raised in the coastal city of Madras, where I completed my schooling. I lived a five minute bicycle ride away from school in what used to be a quiet leafy middle class neighbourhood by the beach. 

My academic career has not followed a traditional trajectory. I graduated with distinction in Chemical engineering from BITS Pilani, Pilani, which was a grueling thirty six-hour journey from my hometown. I won the Monali Dey Memorial Award, which is awarded to a student of every outgoing batch for extracurricular and academic excellence. In my senior year, I was offered a job with Dr. Reddy’s Labs (DRL) a research-driven Indian pharmaceutical company. I joined the product development division at a time when it was ushering in new technological initiatives. In the three years I spent at DRL, I worked alongside synthetic chemists and chemical engineers on the design, development and scale-up of small molecule drugs.  I contributed to two patents and was responsible for the commercial launch of three drugs. I also conducted exploratory research on continuous API manufacturing and process analytical technology. Though I enjoyed industrial research tremendously, I couldn’t envision a career in industry and felt a calling to teaching and academic research. I applied for a PhD in chemical engineering, and was fortunate to be accepted by the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. 

At Michigan, I chose to work with Prof. Joerg Lahann. Joerg leads a group that regularly implements innovative macromolecular engineering approaches to solve problems at the interface of materials and medicine and works at the forefront of translational biomedical research. I was awarded the Rackham Predoctoral Fellowship through a university-level completion which selects 80 people every year. I have also received a 

I love literary fiction and would readily be stranded on an island with the complete works of Edith Wharton, F. Scott Fitzgerald, D.H. Lawrence, Jane Austen and Henry James. Like most of my countrymen, I am an ardent armchair cricket critic and a terrible cricketer. I have completed seven half-marathons and I’m hoping to run a full marathon someday.
