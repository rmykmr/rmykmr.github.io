I have a strong interest in undergraduate teaching, especially the sophomore and junior levels, because I believe that this is the crucial period which determines how passionate students become about the chemical engineering profession. Through my teaching, I want my students to become aware of all the potentialities, excitement and possibilities the profession offers. I am very lucky to have experienced life as a chemical engineer in both industry and in academia and to have acquired expertise in two domains (pharmaceuticals and biomaterials). My varied experiences allow me to motivate my students in multiple ways using field visits, lab visits, games, case studies and role plays. Having taught Chemical and Engineering Thermodynamics in the past, I believe I'm well-suited to teach the course again. I'm excited about the challenge of teaching the introductory course Introduction to material and energy balances , a course that is particularly tricky to teach since students will be in the midst of a difficult transition from freshman to sophomore year. I would also be thrilled to teach Chemical Reaction Engineering since I have applied this course extensively both in industry and in my dissertation. I would like to develop a PhD-level class, Polymeric materials for surface engineering in biomedical applications as this relates to the broad area of my dissertation. In this course, I plan to introduce graduate students with research interests in polymers and interfaces to the ways in which macromolecular chemistry is driving the evolution of biomaterials.
